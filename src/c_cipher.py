    Objective is to encrypt and decrypt an email address that is input by the user. 
    The arguments can be any letter from a to z and any number from 0 to 9. Data
    types are string and integer but the integers will be turned into a string. 
    The variables are the encrypted and decrypted email addresses. Data type string.
